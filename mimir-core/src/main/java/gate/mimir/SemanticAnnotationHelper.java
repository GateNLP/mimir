/**
 * Interface for classes that convert annotations into semantic metadata. At 
 * indexing time, for each annotation to be indexed, the helper produces a set 
 * of mentions URIs (obtained by calling 
 * {@link #getMentionUris(Annotation, int, Indexer)}).
 * At search time, given a set of constraints, the helper produces set of 
 * &lt;mention URIs, mention length&gt; pairs (obtained by calling on of the 
 * {@link #getMentions(String, List, QueryEngine)}, 
 * {@link #getMentions(String, Map, QueryEngine)} methods).
 * 
 * <br>
 * Each helper can function in annotation mode (the default) or in document 
 * mode. The current functioning mode can be obtained by calling 
 * {@link #isInDocumentMode()}. When in document mode, the helper should behave
 * as if a single annotation covering the whole document span is being indexed 
 * (or searched for). In this mode, document features are used instead of 
 * annotation features. This has efficiency advantages over actually creating a 
 * document-spanning annotation, as the implementations can avoid actually 
 * storing the annotation length in the index (as it is always the same as the 
 * document length).
